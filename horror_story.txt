"The Last Notification"

It was 3:12 AM when Megan's phone buzzed.

She lived alone, no friends awake at this hour. The notification just said:
"You left the front door open."
Sent from “Home Assistant.”

She didn’t have a home assistant.

Chills ran down her spine. She tiptoed to the hallway. Her phone buzzed again.

"We’re inside."

The sound of her front door clicking shut echoed through the silence.

Then footsteps.

Not hers.
